# Attach a permissions policy to a secret<a name="auth-and-access_resource-policies"></a>

In a resource\-based policy, you specify who can access the secret and the actions they can perform on the secret\. You can use resource\-based policies to:
+ Grant access to a single secret to multiple users and roles\. 
+ Grant access to users or roles in other AWS accounts\.

See [Permissions policy examples](auth-and-access_examples.md)\.

When you attach a resource\-based policy to a secret in the console, Secrets Manager uses the automated reasoning engine [Zelkova](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/protect-sensitive-data-in-the-cloud-with-automated-reasoning-zelkova/) and the API `ValidateResourcePolicy` to prevent you from granting a wide range of IAM principals access to your secrets\. Alternatively, you can call the `PutResourcePolicy` API with the `BlockPublicPolicy` parameter from the CLI or SDK\. 

**To view, change, or delete the resource policy for a secret \(console\)**

1. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/)\.

1. In the secret details page for your secret, in the **Resource permissions** section, choose **Edit permissions**\.

1. In the code field, do one of the following, and then choose **Save**:
   + To attach or modify a resource policy, enter the policy\. 
   + To delete the policy, clear the code field\.

## AWS CLI<a name="auth-and-access_resource_cli"></a>

To retrieve the policy attached to the secret, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/get-resource-policy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/get-resource-policy.html)\.

**Example**  
The following CLI command retrieves the policy attached to the secret\.  

```
$ aws secretsmanager get-resource-policy --secret-id production/MyAwesomeAppSecret
{
  "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:123456789012:secret:production/MyAwesomeAppSecret-a1b2c3",
  "Name": "MyAwesomeAppSecret",
  "ResourcePolicy": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root\",\"arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root\"},\"Action\":[\"secretsmanager:GetSecret\",\"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\"],\"Resource\":\"*\"}}"
}
```

To delete the policy attached to the secret, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/delete-resource-policy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/delete-resource-policy.html)\.

**Example**  
The following CLI command deletes the policy attached to the secret\.  

```
$ aws secretsmanager delete-resource-policy --secret-id production/MyAwesomeAppSecret
{
  "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:123456789012:secret:production/MyAwesomeAppSecret-a1b2c3",
  "Name": "production/MyAwesomeAppSecret"
}
```

To attach a policy for the secret, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-resource-policy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-resource-policy.html)\. If there is already a policy attached, the command first removes it, and then attaches the new policy\. The policy must be formatted as JSON structured text\. See [JSON policy document structure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies-introduction)\.

**Example**  
The following CLI command attaches the resource\-based policy attached to the secret\. The policy is defined in the file `secretpolicy.json`\. Use the [Permissions policy examples](auth-and-access_examples.md) to get started writing your policy\.  

```
$ aws secretsmanager put-resource-policy --secret-id production/MyAwesomeAppSecret --resource-policy file://secretpolicy.json 
{
  "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:123456789012:secret:production/MyAwesomeAppSecret-a1b2c3",
  "Name": "MyAwesomeAppSecret"
  }
```
