****  

| Request type | Quota \(per second\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| `DescribeSecret` and  `GetSecretValue`, combined | 5,000 | 
| `CreateSecret` | 50  | 
| `DeleteSecret` | 50  | 
| `GetRandomPassword` | 50  | 
|  `ListSecrets` and  `ListSecretVersionIds`, combined  | 50 | 
|  `DeleteResourcePolicy`,  `GetResourcePolicy`, `PutResourcePolicy`, and  `ValidateResourcePolicy`, combined  | 50  | 
|  `PutSecretValue`, `RemoveRegionsFromReplication`, `ReplicateSecretToRegions`, `StopReplicationToReplica`, `UpdateSecret`, and  `UpdateSecretVersionStage`, combined  | 50  | 
| `RestoreSecret` | 50 | 
|  `RotateSecret` and  `CancelRotateSecret`, combined  | 50  | 
|  `TagResource` and  `UntagResource`, combined  | 50  | 

We recommend you avoid calling `PutSecretValue` or `UpdateSecret` at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes\. When you call `PutSecretValue` or `UpdateSecret` to update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret\. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago\. If you update the secret value more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions\.
